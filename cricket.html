<p style="font-size:20px;color:darkgreen"><strong>Cricket</strong> is played with <b> two teams of 11 players </b>a side,one being the batting team while the other one is the fielding team. 
    It is generally played on field with the main playing surface being called a <strong>"pitch"</strong>. 
    Team <b>A</b> will bat first and try to score as many <b>runs</b> as possible while the second team, 
    team <b>B</b>, will bowl and field to make it as hard as possible for the batting team <b>A</b> to score these runs and to get them <em>out</em>.
    Once team <b>B</b> are all out or otherwise their batting is determined closed as per the laws,the teams then swap over.
    So team <b>B</b> will bat to try and <em>beat</em> the score (number of runs scored) set by team <b>A</b>. 
    Team <b>B</b> will bowl and field and try and restrict Team <b>B</b> from beating their score and getting them <em>all out</em> before they do.</p>
