    <h1><maquee>HISTORY OF TWENTY-TWENTY (T20) CRICKET</maquee></h1>   
<p>
A Twenty20 International (T20I) is a form of cricket, played between two of the top members of the
International Cricket Council (ICC), in which each team faces 20 overs. The matches have major status 
and are the highest T20 standard. The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket.
The shortened format was initially introduced to bolster crowds for the domestic game, and was not intended
to be played internationally, but the first Twenty20 International took place on 17 February 2005
when Australia defeated New Zealand, and the first tournament was played two years later,
with the introduction of the ICC World Twenty20. There remain limits on how many Twenty20 Internationals
a team can play each year, in order to protect Test cricket and One Day Internationals.
As of 2016, there are 17 nations that feature in ICC T20I team rankings
