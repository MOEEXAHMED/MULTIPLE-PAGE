    <h1><marquee>HISTORY OF ONE DAY CRICKET</marquee></h1>
<p>
A One Day International (ODI) is a form of limited overs cricket, 
played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs,
usually 50 overs. The Cricket World Cup is played in this format. One Day International matches are also called 
Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may also refer to Twenty20 International matches. 
They are major matches and considered the highest standard of limited overs competition.

The international one-day game is a late twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971
between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. When the first three days of the third 
Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and, instead, play a one-off one day game consisting 
of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in white kits with a red ball.
