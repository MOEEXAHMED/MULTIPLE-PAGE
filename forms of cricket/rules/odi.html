    <h1>ONE DAY Cricket Rules</h1>
    <br>    
    <h2>General Rules:</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>In a single innings, each of the bowlers can bowl a maximum of only one-fifth 
    of the total overs i.e. 10 overs in a total of 50 overs.</li>
<li>If a bowler ever delivers a ball overstepping the popping crease, it is a no-ball. 
    The batting team gets one run for the ball and the next delivery is a free hit. In other words, in the next ball,
    the batsmen can only be dismissed through a run out.</li>
<li>If either of the umpires believes that a team is wasting time, he can award a five-run penalty, at his own discretion.</li>
<li>In a normal ONE DAY game, the interval lasts for 30 minutes. However, in a reduced-overs match, it can be cut minutes.</li>
<li>If, and only if, each of the two teams has faced (or had the opportunity to face) five overs, will be a match deemed to have played.</li>
<li>In each ONE DAY cricket match, one short-pitched ball is allowed per over.</li>
<li>To calculate a team's net run rate, the average runs per over scored by that team is deducted from 
    the average runs per over scored against it.</li>
</ol>
